# OpenGL Vertex Buffer Renderer

_Note_ planned some pretty big api change, readme updates when it's closer to something easier to use


it's at a pretty nice spot for starting new projects without having to do a ton of work, without any real application specific operations

## About

This project was created for learning and improvement purposes, please do not mistake this for a valid option of OpenGL renderers.


While I created this for my own sake, feel free to make any improvement suggestions or even pull requests if you like. Feel free
to open up an issue for anything else. it's not very complex or anything, it renders tris defined by a vertex buffer of verticies.
color can be controlled through shader uniforms


for more OpenGL resources check out these [opengl docs](https://docs.gl/) or the [glew docs](https://www.glfw.org/) which also has dlls available
if you'd rather include it that way.
